# Welcome to Pocket Crypto 

- Pocket Crypto is an application created using the latest React version which tracks the most Top 10 Trending Coins in the market along with the all of the coins available on the CoinGecko API. 

# Why Pocket Crypto? 

- The idea was simple, create an application that I can access from my phone and keep track of my crypto assets right from my pocket. 

# The Experience 

- Creating Pocket Crypto has been one of the coolest things I have done. Before starting this, I had already created a few applications using React. This one was a little different because it was just my brain and I putting things together. One of the biggest challenges was creating the charts that live track the prices of crypto assets. I used chart.js, a javascript library I had zero experience with. After a few long nights using the docs as a guide I was finally able to implement the charts for each crypto using react's ability to dynamically render data. As I continued to add features to the site, I would occassionally show it off to my friends. By doing this, it allowed me to explain technical concepts and decisions I had to make with non-technical audiences. This put me in a position to recieve feedback from non-technical people which in the long run has really helped me because it allows me to always keep the end user in-mind while developing.
